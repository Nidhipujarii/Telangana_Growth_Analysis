# Problem Statements & Insights
## Stamp Registration
### 1. List down the top 5 districts that showed the highest document registration revenue growth between FY 2019 and 2022.
![telang 1](https://github.com/Nidhipujarii/Telangana_Growth_Analysis/assets/107934279/41c76361-5d86-4704-993b-5f769882c87e)

+ **Medchal_Malkajgiri** experienced the highest document registration  revenue growth followed by **Hyderabad** and **Rangareddy**.

+ **Sangareddy** and **Hanumakonda holds** 4th and 5th place respectively in document registration revenue.

### 2.  List down the top 5 districts where e-stamps revenue contributes significantly more to the revenue than the documents in FY 2022.

+ In the second position, we find **Sangareddy**.
+ Securing the third spot is **Khammam**, showcasing a notable preference for e-stamps followed by **Hanumakonda**  and **Narayanpet**.

###  3. Is there any alteration of e-Stamp challan count and document registration count pattern since the implementation of e-Stamp challan? If so, what suggestions would you propose to the government?

## Suggestions
To address the current situation, I recommend the following suggestions to the government:
+ Launch awareness campaigns to inform people about the benefits of using e-Stamps
+ If there are any complexities in using e-Stamps, efforts should be made to simplify the process. The easier and more user-friendly the system, the more likely people will be to using it.

### 4. Categorize districts into three segments based on their stamp registration revenue generation during the fiscal year 2021 to 2022.
 **HIGH REVENUE DISTRICTS**
  
   + In high revenue category we have districts  whose revenue is more that 1 billion.
   + So in this category we have 16  districts, who have collectively generated an impressive revenue of around 82.77 billion and they contributed around 113.91% of the total 
     revenue.
   + These districts are predominantly urban and semi-urban regions
     
![telang 4](https://github.com/Nidhipujarii/Telangana_Growth_Analysis/assets/107934279/841b8dfe-49f5-4125-808a-fa33188027d3)

 **MEDIUM REVENUE DISTRICTS**
 
  + Within the "Medium Revenue" category, we have districts  whose revenue is more that 500 million and in this category we have 10 districts who have collectively generated an revenue 
    of around 7.42 billion and they contributed around 10.22% of the total revenue

![telang 5](https://github.com/Nidhipujarii/Telangana_Growth_Analysis/assets/107934279/d6295b2a-1a28-47b4-9151-e96f9bab0333)

 **LOW REVENUE DISTRICTS**

  + In the "Low Revenue" category, there are four districts with individual revenues less than 500 million INR. However, collectively, these districts have generated a significant total 
    revenue of 1 billion INR.
  + Despite their relatively lower individual contributions, together, they account for approximately 1.85% of the total revenue.

## Transportation
### 1. Investigate whether there is any correlation between vehicle sales and specific months or seasons in different districts. Are there any months or seasons that consistently show higher or lower sales rate, and if yes, what could be the driving factors? (Consider Fuel-Type category only

![telang 7](https://github.com/Nidhipujarii/Telangana_Growth_Analysis/assets/107934279/6b3a93f6-25dd-4b67-96b9-8679fde1836e)
+ October stands out as the month with the highest sales.
+ June and March also have high sales figures.
+ May and April, on the other hand, have lower sales rates.
+ **Now reason behind October’s remarkable performance could be:**
  
  > The beginning of the festive season in India, starting with Navratri, followed by Diwali, and other regional festivals. Due to this festivals there are continous offers running.
+ **Resaon behind lower sales in may and April could be:**
  > Weather Conditions or May and April may not be peak months for promotional campaigns

### 2. How does the distribution of vehicles vary by vehicle class (MotorCycle, MotorCar, AutoRickshaw, Agriculture) across different districts? Are there any districts with a predominant preference for a specific vehicle class? Consider FY 2022 for analysis.

![telang 8](https://github.com/Nidhipujarii/Telangana_Growth_Analysis/assets/107934279/0e5b0a2e-1c5e-41f5-9c5a-f4a5f5decd6f)

+ Motorcycles appear to be the most popular vehicle class across most districts, This suggests that motorcycles are the preferred mode of transportation in most districts 
+ Motorcars are also widely used, although their prevalence is generally lower compared to motorcycles but they are widely used in urban areas.
+ AutoRickshaws are predominantly used for transportation in a few districts
+ Agriculture vehicles are most commonly used in districts with significant agricultural activities.
+ Other vehicles" category usage varies widely among districts, indicating diverse transportation needs or preferences.

**So looking at this trend we can conclude that:**
+ Motorcycles are the most popular vehicle class across most districts.
+ Motorcars are widely used, especially in urban areas

### 3. List down the top 3 and bottom 3 districts that have shown the highest and lowest vehicle sales growth during FY 2022 compared to FY 2021? (Consider and compare categories: Petrol, Diesel and Electric)

![telang 10](https://github.com/Nidhipujarii/Telangana_Growth_Analysis/assets/107934279/d81fbab8-b907-456b-9797-aaf5878aeb60)

![telang 11](https://github.com/Nidhipujarii/Telangana_Growth_Analysis/assets/107934279/6e4d962f-610f-4ace-918c-a37b01590ec8)

![telang 12](https://github.com/Nidhipujarii/Telangana_Growth_Analysis/assets/107934279/f3cabcec-fd10-48e4-bbbf-32d3d545a7f6)

![telang 13](https://github.com/Nidhipujarii/Telangana_Growth_Analysis/assets/107934279/013d58d3-6112-4c35-bfea-9bb3c6591c0b)

### From these insights, it's reasonable to conclude that there is a noticeable trend of consumers shifting towards electric vehicles, which could be contributing to lower sales in the traditional fuel category. Additionally, the consistently high fuel prices in India might also be a significant factor leading to reduced sales of vehicles running on conventional fuels.
