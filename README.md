## Suggestions
To address the current situation, I recommend the following suggestions to the government:
+ Launch awareness campaigns to inform people about the benefits of using e-Stamps
+ If there are any complexities in using e-Stamps, efforts should be made to simplify the process. The easier and more user-friendly the system, the more likely people will be to using it.

### 4. Categorize districts into three segments based on their stamp registration revenue generation during the fiscal year 2021 to 2022.
